- 👋 Hi, I’m Md Sakhawat Hossen
- 👀 I’m mostly interested and skilled in Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning Database Administration (MySql & IBM DB2), Data preprocessing, Bayesian Inference, and Probability. My skillsets are necessary for providing insights on a small scale and big-scale business-oriented and Scientific data by statistical analysis and Inference, building robust Statistical and Machine Learning models based on available data. Through the years, I have acquired in-depth knowledge of Data extraction from any database system, Data Manipulation, Data Wrangling, Exploratory, and Statistical Data analysis, producing reproducible Statistical Reports providing insights on data, and deploying Machine Learning and Statistical Models. I am adept both in R and Python programming languages which are the best choices for modern-day Data Analysis and Machine Learning applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep Learning And Machine Learning Algorithms
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project
